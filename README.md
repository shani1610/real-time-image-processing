# Real Time Image Processing

This repository contains the results of practical works for the Real time processing of conventional and non-conventional images with
GPUs class in Jean Monnet University, lectured by Professor Philippe Colantoni. 
This course introduces basic and advanced techniques dedicated for General-Purpose processing on
Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU). It introduces the basic concepts of parallel programming and shows how
to use the computing power of modern GPUs for conventional/non-conventional images processing in real
time. 

## Content
Introduction to parallel programming; Introduction to General-purpose processing on graphics processing
units (GPGPU): GPGPU with shaders, CUDA; Image processing with graphic shaders and compute shaders
(application with WebGL for web applications); CUDA based image processing (application with OpenCV for
native applications)
Case of studies: Implementation of conventional color image/video processing methods, Implementation of
non-conventional image processing methods

### Practical Work 1: Tasks 1 + 2 Primitives, Cameras and Controls

in the first task we were asked to create a scene that contains on the same plane (XY) all the primitives available in three.js. next, reproduce these primitives 3 times on the Z axis by modifying at least one parameter of their geometry. next, write a function allowing to create marks (cross based on segments) on the ground of a 3D environment that fade away as it goes far from the primitives. 
in the second task we were asked in the same web page, display the previous scene twice: one scene with an orthographic camera and second one with a perspective camera. next, use the different control techniques available in three.js to interact with these 2 types of cameras.
