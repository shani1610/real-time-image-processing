# Real Time Image Processing

This repository contains the results of practical works for the Real time processing of conventional and non-conventional images with
GPUs class in Jean Monnet University, lectured by Professor Philippe Colantoni. 
This course introduces basic and advanced techniques dedicated for General-Purpose processing on
Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU). It introduces the basic concepts of parallel programming and shows how
to use the computing power of modern GPUs for conventional/non-conventional images processing in real
time. 

## Content
Introduction to parallel programming; Introduction to General-purpose processing on graphics processing
units (GPGPU): GPGPU with shaders, CUDA; Image processing with graphic shaders and compute shaders
(application with WebGL for web applications); CUDA based image processing (application with OpenCV for
native applications)
Case of studies: Implementation of conventional color image/video processing methods, Implementation of
non-conventional image processing methods
